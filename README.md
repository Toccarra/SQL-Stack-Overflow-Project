STACK OVERFLOW SURVEY ANALYSIS : DATA AND BUSINESS ANALYST


In May 2023 over 90,000 developers responded to our annual survey about how they learn and level up, which tools they're using, and which ones they want. The survey response is sourced from the Stack OverFlow community and provides the latest trends in technology, years in experience for using tools, preferred learning resources, attitudes towards AI/ML technology, and other factors that may impacy how developers solve problems.  


Some of these results were examined using SQL and visualized in this project with aim to analyze data specific to Data and Business Analyst.
